Recipe CRUD App
In this project, you will build a Recipe tracking app. The app will allow a user to add new recipes, display a list of recipes and delete a recipe from the list by clicking a delete button. You will also be asked to add styling as provided in the mockup.

## Specific Instructions
Find the TODO comments in the code and create the necessary functionality. Below is a list of specific items you will need to complete for this lesson.

* The app will display a recipe's name, cuisine, photo, ingredients, preparation instructions and action buttons (delete).
* You should create at least one additional component that is used by the RecipeList component.
* The app does not need to match the exact appearance of the mockup, but should be similar and pass the styling tests.
* You should add handlers and other attributes to the starter code as needed.
  
The new recipe must be added to the end of the list of recipes.

## Success Criteria
* Functionality:
1. User can create a recipe entry.
2. User can read the list of recipes. The new recipe must be added to the end of the list of recipes.
3. User can delete a recipe.
4. CSS is used to make the app look like the mockup.
* React Code Organization:
1. Uses multiple components that play well together.
2. Recipe data is contained in the state.
* General Code Organization:
1. Minimal code duplication
